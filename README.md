dotfiles
========

This contains all my config files for various \*nix stuff (bash, vim, etc.)

Installation
------------

1. Go and install:
  * iTerm
  * Alfred
  * SnappyApp
  * nvAlt
2. There's an iTerm color theme in `/iterm`. Open iTerm, go to `settings -> profiles -> colors` and click on `Import`
   under `Load Presets`. Navigate to the theme in `/iterm`.
3. Run `install.sh` and pray for the best.
