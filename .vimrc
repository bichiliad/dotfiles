"
" GENERAL CONFIG
"
" I tried to keep these grouped in
" pretty logical sections, and I 
" commented this pretty heavily, 
" since vim settings can kinda be
" opaque sometimes.
"
" ---------------------------------


" Coloring and syntax highlighting

" Set support for 256 colors
let &t_Co=256
" Use this: https://github.com/rakr/vim-one
" colorscheme desert
" colorscheme one
colorscheme atom-dark-256
" colorscheme papaya_original
" Let the theme know we want a dark background
set background=dark
" Treat mustache files like html 
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.mustache set filetype=html
" And treat long files like the scum they are (i.e. don't color them)
au BufReadPost * if getfsize(bufname("%")) > 5*100*1024 | set syntax= | endif
" Ignore background of the theme so that we can see through to whatever tmux
" sets the background to. This is useful if, say, you have tmux changing the
" colors of the background if a pane is inactive.
hi Normal guibg=NONE ctermbg=NONE



" Basic config

" Allow for hidden buffers
set hidden
" Don't try to be compatable with vi
set nocompatible
" Delete auto-indentation, line breaks, insert mode start points
set backspace=indent,eol,start
" Show where we are in the file (line/char)
set ruler
" Show line numbers
set number
" And make them relative
set relativenumber
" Lets see what we're commanding
set showcmd
" Don't get too close to the top/bottom (within 5 lines)
set so=5
" Visual bell instead of beeps
set visualbell
" Open new splits below / to the right, instead of not that.
set splitbelow
set splitright
" Make splits equal always (except on resize, which isn't 'always' I guess); 
set equalalways
" Remember the buffers I had open.
:exec 'set viminfo=%,' . &viminfo
" Indent lines smartly when they wrap
set breakindent
" And tab any wrapped lines in by two tab's worth of spaces
set breakindentopt=shift:8
" Edit a copy of a file, and overwrite the original on save.
" Having this set to `auto` can mess with things that use
" filesystem watchers (like webpack)
set backupcopy=yes

" Cursor

" Make the cursor look different in different modes
" Suited for tmux in iTerm on OSX (I know right)
" See here for more permutations: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Change_cursor_shape_in_different_modes
let &t_SI = "\<Esc>Ptmux;\<Esc>\<Esc>]50;CursorShape=1\x7\<Esc>\\"
let &t_EI = "\<Esc>Ptmux;\<Esc>\<Esc>]50;CursorShape=0\x7\<Esc>\\"


" Indentation

" Use autoindent if filetype based indent doesn't work
set autoindent
" Tab is four columns. This changes how text is displayed.
set tabstop=4
" Reindenting and autoindenting moves things by 4 columns
set shiftwidth=4
" Hitting tab in insert mode inserts spaces
set expandtab
" 'softtabstop' i.e. make spaces feel like tabs (when deleting, etc). 
set sts=4
" shift + tab moves the line to the left
imap <S-Tab> <C-o><<
" stay in visual mode after reindenting forward
vnoremap < <gv
" ...or backward
vnoremap > >gv


" Whitespace trimming

" Delete trailing space on save in php
autocmd BufWritePre *.php :%s/\s\+$//e
" Delete trailing space on save in js
autocmd BufWritePre *.js :%s/\s\+$//e
" Delete trailing space on save in jsx
autocmd BufWritePre *.jsx :%s/\s\+$//e
" Delete trailing space on save in css
" autocmd BufWritePre *.css :%s/\s\+$//e
" Delete trailing space on save in smarty template files
" autocmd BufWritePre *.tpl :%s/\s\+$//e
" Delete trailing space on save in mustache template files
" autocmd BufWritePre *.mustache :%s/\s\+$//e

" Mouse mode

" Enable mouse mode, if the terminal supports it. 
if has('mouse')
  set mouse=a

" Wildmenu

" Enable the wildmenu (that menu at the bottom of the editor)
set wildmenu
" When you hit tab in the command line, autocomplete as far as possible on the
" first tab, and then show the wild menu with everything on the second tab.
set wildmode=list:longest,full
" Patterns to ignore in the wildmenu
set wildignore+=*/tmp/*,*.so,*.swp,*.zip,*/node_modules/*,
" Ignore the case of a filename when autocompleting.

" Difftool

" Show vertical splits when diffing a file.
set diffopt+=vertical
" Ignore whitespace in a diff because that shit's annoying
set diffopt+=iwhite

" Folding

" Inform code folding based on the syntax
set foldmethod=syntax
" and don't fold anything by default (unless you somehow have a file with 99
" levels of indentation). 
set foldlevelstart=99


" Searching

" ignore case when searching
set ignorecase
" ...unless we search with an uppercase letter
set smartcase
" auto-open the quickfix menu on :Grep
autocmd QuickFixCmdPost *grep* cwindow


" Cursor line stuff

" Highlight the current line in the current pane only.
" This makes it easier to tell which window is active
augroup CursorLine
  au!
  au VimEnter,WinEnter,BufWinEnter * setlocal cursorline
  au WinLeave * setlocal nocursorline

" Highlight column 90 in the active pane only.
" This makes it easier to tell which window is active
set colorcolumn=90
augroup BgHighlight
    autocmd!
    autocmd WinEnter * set colorcolumn=90
    autocmd WinLeave * set colorcolumn=0
augroup END

" Close current buffer with ctrl+c, and then drop the focus on
" the last file that you edited. It should leave panes alone.
